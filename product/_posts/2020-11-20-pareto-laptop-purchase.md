I was on the search for my next laptop after I handed down my longstanding Lenovo to my nephew. Deciding on one really put my minimalism values to test. There are so many parts to understand and form an opinion on. I found that the deeper you go into the rabbit-hole of internet reviews about different laptops, the harder it gets to come out of it with a decision. I needed help. So I went to my trusted ally Pareto.

Before that, some context about me as a customer. I am not locked into any brand ecosystem. I was open to the entire available spectrum of laptops at the beginning. Such an open-ended starting point also meant processing an overwhelming amount of information with no reliable framework to compare. Which brands should I consider? How much should my laptop weigh? What screen size and type is suitable? How much processing capacity and memory do I need? Do I need a graphics card? What is a reasonable price? The list goes on. It was clear I needed to make trade-offs. It was time to Pareto it and avoid the [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) now and possible [buyer’s remorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer%27s_remorse) later. 

> It was clear I needed to make trade-offs. It was time to Pareto it.

[Pareto’s 80-20 rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) asserts that 80% of outcomes (outputs) result from 20% of all causes (inputs). The beauty of this simple yet elegant rule is that you can extend the essence of it to a wide range of areas. In any decision-making scenario, one can tweak this to identify the 20% information that will have an 80% impact on stated objectives. Simply put, this principle drives clarity on what matters the most and enables a bias for action.

Pareto guiding my Laptop Purchase

In this example of purchasing a laptop, I first listed down my use cases and categorized the few product features I absolutely *needed*, *wanted*, and would be *great to have*. I researched and went through many online reviews like this one by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2020/08/22/2020-dell-xps-15-9500-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro-and-the-winner-isquick-compare-and-review/?sh=260817cc56d0). Then, I penned down (and quantified wherever possible) my minimum requirements on the core product features of most importance to me.

Sample list for illustration

Needed:

- portable (thin and light), powerful (processing capacity) notebook that is tried and tested (user reviews)

- 14-16 inch screen with at least HD display. I was clear I did NOT want a touch screen (costlier and more battery draining without significant value-add for my use cases)

- Good keyboard a comfortable track pad because I plan to write and code more

- Durable (should serve me 4 years at the least)

- Hardware minimum specifications: 16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, Nvidia Graphics Card (for Data Science use)

- Cost: a maximum budget amount of Rs Y (arrived at this after a quick primary market research)

- Usage: smooth and user-friendly programming environment

Wanted:

- Weigh below 1.5 kgs

- UHD+ screen

- Cost: 80% of my max budget Y

- Looks: Slick and not corporate-y looking

- Ports: USB-A and USB-C, HDMI

Great to have:

- Bezel-less experience of the screen

- Cost: Below 80% of my max budget (Black Friday or Diwali sale etc.)

- 12+ hours of battery life

This sample list is only to illustrate the clarification step. During the research I removed, added, and updated the points.

I was also aware of my biases.

- happy working on Ubuntu via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) and the new Terminal

- Microsoft pivoting from their old ways and embracing Open Source by acquiring GitHub (one of my favorite [products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiWjanAdD3s)), bringing in Python creator Guido Von Rossum, releasing WSL2, and making VS Code open source played a role in avoiding a blind bias towards Apple’s legacy high-quality products and ecosystem

- happy with my Android-based phone

- exposure to Apple users who have had to shell out a lot of money on repairs and to stay within the Apple ecosystem

This process helped me become clearer about what I was not willing to compromise and the trade-offs I had to make. Example of a trade-off: I wanted a USB-A & HMDI port. But the laptop I arrived at that met most of my other important criteria came with only USB-C. I was okay solving this by buying a convertor. After a few such rounds of filtering and trade-off handling, I finally picked the Dell XPS 15 over the MacBook 16 and Lenovo X1 and purchased it on a Black Friday sale.

Pareto Principle - a handy tool for Product Managers

I use the example of a big ticket purchase decision only as an example here. We can apply the Pareto principle in most decision-making situations where you have some time and multiple data points to interpret and analyze. I would advise against forcing the model on all decisions. Sometimes it is overkill. Sometimes it it is extremely helpful. Balance time, cost and quality/impact to know where it makes sense to invoke Pareto.

Prioritizing features and grooming the backlog is an important activity for Product Managers. The Pareto Principle comes in handy here to drive clarity on what matters the most. Focusing on a North Star metric ([Every Product Needs a North Star Metric - by Amplitude](https://blog.amplitude.com/product-north-star-metric)) is often more valuable than optimizing local KPIs with a myopic focus. 

As a PM, you do not work in isolation (like with purchasing your laptop). You need to communicate and negotiate with other stakeholders about their competing priorities. The Pareto method of decision-making allows you to strengthen your communication with focus and consistency. So, the next time you face a situation where you have to decide or prioritize - go ahead and *Pareto it*!
