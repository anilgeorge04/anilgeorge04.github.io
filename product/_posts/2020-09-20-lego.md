Ah, the good old childhood days of playing with your Lego sets. I went down this memory lane last week when I visited a bookstore and found a Lego play area. I added bricks to someone else’s tower and built a car next to it. `#opensource #ftw`

*Fun fact*: “Lego” was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means “play well”.

<p>In this analysis, let's explore the colors of the bricks and the different parts and themes of the sets.</p>

<p>Exploring the distribution of transparent vs. non-transparent colors.</p>
