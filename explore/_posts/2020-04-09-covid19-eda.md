### About
This is a DataCamp Tutorial to study the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and explore the data using some foundational packages in the Scientific Python Data Science stack.

### In the notebook, I 
- melt the data into long format,
- use Altair to make interactive plots of increasing richness

### My main takeaway: 
Logarithmic scale is great for plotting, but in day to day life, we live on the linear scale.
