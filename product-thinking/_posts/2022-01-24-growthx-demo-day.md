A well spent Sunday afternoon attending the GrowthX demo day!

I got a glimpse today into

1. the future of Indian entrepreneurship
2. how infectious the optimistic energy in a community can be
3. related to 2 + a hunch -> why DAO values will be core to innovations in the future

[GrowthX](https://www.growthx.club/) is a closed community of top operators & founders looking to accelerate their careers & companies. They run an intensive and practical 8-week cohort based learning program to help members understand & practice the end-to-end lifecycle of Product Growth. All my friends who've gone through the program swear by the community.

They hold a demo day at the end of each cohort to showcase the capstone projects of 3 top performing groups. This Sunday, the winning groups presented the Growth models for [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/), [copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/), and [Ditto](https://joinditto.in/) insurance. Here are some of my broad takeaways:

**Features may get commoditized, instead...**

- reimagine the problem & the world
- think of non-linear growth channels (strategic partnerships, content loops, etc.)
- always think how can you give before getting
    - this is my core value - [Create value. Capture value. Repeat.](/about)

**A framework to think through the growth problem:**

- clearly articulate the problem (most critical step)
- define the product, user, and market
- think through the Growth model & make funnel level bets (acquisition, onboarding, retention, engagement, retention & monetization)

> # Pick a few bets & go deep

The community seems smart, driven, and ambitious yet genuinely warm and welcoming. Fresh cohort starts every 8-10 weeks.
