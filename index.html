<div>
    <p>I'm <a href="/about/">Anil</a>. I follow my curiosity, tinker around, and look to learn from discussions around 3 areas that I'm passionate about:
        <ul>Join in on the <a href="/categories/#product-thinking">product thinking</a> discussions if you like to solve problems, use simple mental models, scale ideas, and create value.</ul>
        <ul>I believe there needs to be more open discussions on 3 foundational pillars of <a href="/categories/#wellness">wellness</a> - physical, mental, and financial well-being. I see many people in their 20s making poor lifestyle choices early on in these areas and compromising on what they're truly capable of. Let's discuss how we can compound good habits.</ul>
        <ul>At other times, I'm <a href="/categories/#just-curious">just curious</a> and looking to explore data and learn something new & interesting.</ul></p>
