    <p>I'm <a href="/about/">Anil</a>. I follow my curiosity, tinker around, and look to learn from discussions around areas that I'm passionate about:
        <ol>Join in on the <a href="/categories/product-thinking">product thinking</a> discussions if you like to solve problems, use simple mental models, study products, and create value.</ol>
        <ol>I think of <a href="/categories/wellness">wellness</a> as standing on 4 pillars: education, physical, mental, and financial health. I plan to write and discuss more on this in the future.</ol>
        <ol>Most of the time, I'm <a href="/categories/just-curious">just curious</a> and looking to explore data and learn something new & interesting.</ol></p>
