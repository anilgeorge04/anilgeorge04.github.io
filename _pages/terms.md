## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.

First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information to anyone without your direct consent.

### Cookies and Web Beacons
Third-party advertisers may place and read cookies on your browser and/or use web beacons to collect information. This site has no access or control over these cookies. You should review the respective privacy policies on any and all third-party ad servers for more information regarding their practices and how to opt-out.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your web browser options. Instructions for doing so can be found on the specific web browsers’ websites.

### Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a web analytics tool I use to help understand how visitors engage with this website. It reports website trends using cookies and web beacons without identifying individual visitors. You can read [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/).

## Disclosure Policy
Access and subscription to my website is free. I intend to use the Amazon and Google Adsense affiliate program. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because I’ll get a percentage of that sale. My intention is to always keep this site clean and minimal.

What this means for you:

- Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a need of or genuine interest in.
- I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.
- I do not let compensation influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
- I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, my Disclosure Policy is a work in progress. If anything above changes, I will update this page.
