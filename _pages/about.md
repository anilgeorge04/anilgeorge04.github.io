### About me
Hi, I’m Anil. I like to build products, teams, and systems to scale ideas. Currently, I’m consulting and advising early-stage startups.

I was the Vice President of Operations at [91springboard](https://www.91springboard.com/), India’s largest co-working chain. As employee #4, I wore different hats at different times to scale the organization to a ~$200mn firm with ~400 employees over 6 years. I’ve held sessions on Coworking Performance Metrics across conferences in [Europe](https://socialworkplaces.com/coworking-measure-metrics-business/) and South East Asia. Previously, I worked at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/) in Data Science & Management Consulting, and at [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) in Software Development.

I completed my Postgraduate in Liberal Studies at the [Young India Fellowship](https://ashoka.edu.in/yif) from Ashoka University in Delhi and studied General Management at [IIM Bangalore](https://www.iimb.ac.in/home) & Computer Science at [PSG College of Technology](https://www.psgtech.edu/) Coimbatore.

I’m interested in sports, meditation, education, products, data, and online learning.<br>Ultimate Frisbee is a [big part](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india) of my life.

### Why Minimal Cave?
**Minimal**: for my love of simplicity.
**Cave**: a quiet place for me to tinker around.

I explore data, analyze products, simplify concepts, and occasionally share snippets from my meditation journal here. I keep the format short and crisp. If any of this interests you, subscribe now and

### About the site
This site is another project I enjoy tinkering around with. It exposed me to the absolute brilliance of open-source tools and community.

Powered by the Ruby projects [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/minimal-mistakes/), the entire website runs for free. [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) runs the comment system and discussions while [follow.it](https://follow.it/s/7z1U) powers the email subscriptions via RSS feed.
