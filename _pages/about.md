Hi there, I'm Anil!👋 

I’m a product builder with a background spanning software engineering, liberal arts, business management, and team sports. Right now, I’m building [Pageloop](https://pageloop.ai) — helping companies automatically maintain their product knowledge bases.

Earlier, I led operations and served as chief of staff at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) and on the founding team at [91springboard](https://91springboard.com). I care deeply about simplicity, objectivity, and solving problems empathetically from first principles.

Two lines I live by:

> “Do not take life too seriously.”

> “You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf.”
