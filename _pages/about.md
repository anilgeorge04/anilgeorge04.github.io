### About me
Hi, I’m Anil - a startup enthusiast and an Ultimate Frisbee [athlete](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india). I like to build products, teams, and systems to scale ideas. Currently, I’m consulting with a few early-stage startups.

I was the Vice President of Operations at [91springboard](https://www.91springboard.com/), India’s largest co-working chain. As employee #4, I wore different hats at different times to scale the organization to a ~$200mn firm with ~400 employees over 6 years. I’ve held sessions on Coworking Performance Metrics across conferences in [Europe](https://socialworkplaces.com/coworking-measure-metrics-business/) and South East Asia. 

Previously, I worked at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/) in Data Science & Management Consulting, and at [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) in Software Development. I studied Liberal Arts, General Management & Computer Science from [Young India Fellowship](https://ashoka.edu.in/yif), [IIM Bangalore](https://www.iimb.ac.in/home) & [PSG College of Technology](https://www.psgtech.edu/).

### Why Minimal Cave?
**Minimal**: for my love of simplicity.
**Cave**: a quiet place for me to tinker around.

I follow my curiosity, explore data, analyze products, simplify concepts, and look to learn here. I keep the format short and crisp. I want to start an open discussion around mental, physical, and financial well-being of folks early in their career.

### About the site
This site is another project I enjoy tinkering around with. It exposed me to the absolute brilliance of open-source tools and community.
