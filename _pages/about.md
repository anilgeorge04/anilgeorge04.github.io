Hi there! I'm Anil, a Business Transformation Manager at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com). 

I'm a software engineer turned business professional with a background in Liberal Arts and IT. I enjoy learning new perspectives, matching patterns, and playing with data. I patiently break problems down and ask a lot of questions till I understand something.

Prior to Airbnb, I headed Operations at [91springboard](https://91springboard.com), a community-led coworking chain that we took from 0 to 1 to 10. I have also worked in product, consulting, and analytics roles.

I've [played](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india) team sports for as long as I can rememeber. This has shaped my approach to work, health, relationships, and more. Winning as a team makes me tick.

I enjoy [building](/building) things. Currently, along with a couple of close friends, we are building a non-profit called [STEP](https://stepnortheast.org/) to bridge education and opportunity gaps in North East India. Write to me if you can contribute towards the program as a faculty or mentor or facilitator or donor.
