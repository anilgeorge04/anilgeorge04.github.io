Hi there, I'm Anil!ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a product builder with a background in software engineering, liberal arts, business management, and team sports. Currently, I'm building [Pageloop](https://pageloop.ai) to help companies auto-maintain their product knowledge bases.

Previously, I headed Operations and held chief-of-staff roles at the founding, scaling, and scaled stages of customer-centric companies like [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) and [91springboard](https://91springboard.com).

I value simplicity, objectivity, and empathetic problem-solving from first principles.
