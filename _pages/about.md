Hi, I'm Anil. I like to build products, teams, and systems to scale ideas.

I was the Vice President of Operations at [91springboard](https://www.91springboard.com/), India's largest co-working chain. I was part of the early team of 5 that grew the organization to a ~$200mn firm with ~400 employees over the last 6 years. I've conducted sessions on Coworking Performance Metrics across Coworking Unconference Asia in Chiang Mai, [Coworking Europe Conference](https://socialworkplaces.com/coworking-measure-metrics-business/) in Brussels and other conferences in India. 
Previously, I worked at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/) in Data Science & Consulting, and at [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) in Software Development. 

I completed my Postgraduate in Liberal Studies at the [Young India Fellowship](https://ashoka.edu.in/yif), Ashoka University in Delhi, and studied General Management at [IIM Bangalore](https://www.iimb.ac.in/home) & Computer Science at [PSG College of Technology](https://www.psgtech.edu/) Coimbatore.

My interests lie in sports, meditation, education, and online learning. I was the Founding President of [Delhi Ultimate](https://www.facebook.com/pg/DelhiUltimate/about/), the official governing body for Ultimate Frisbee in Delhi & NCR. I [represented India](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india) in Ultimate Frisbee at Asia Championship in Hong Kong. I currently live in Goa, advise startups, and play for the state team here.
