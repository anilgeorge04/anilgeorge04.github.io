### About me
Hi, I’m Anil - a startup enthusiast and an Ultimate Frisbee [athlete](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india). I like to build products, teams, and systems to scale ideas. Currently, I’m consulting with a few early-stage startups.

I was part of the Founding Team at [91springboard](https://www.91springboard.com/), India’s largest coworking community. As VP of Operations, I wore different hats over 6 years to build and scale the idea to a ~$200M firm with ~400 employees. Previously, I worked at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/) in Data Science & Management Consulting, and at [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) in Software Development. 

I studied Liberal Arts, General Management & Computer Science from [Young India Fellowship](https://ashoka.edu.in/yif), [IIM Bangalore](https://www.iimb.ac.in/home) & [PSG College of Technology](https://www.psgtech.edu/).
