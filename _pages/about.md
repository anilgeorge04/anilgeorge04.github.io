Hi! I'm Anil, a software engineer turned business professional with a decade of experience in building high-performing teams & systems to drive operational excellence, cross-functional programs, product strategy, and data analytics. I'm currently learning the ropes as a Founder.

Working at the intersection of Tech and Business, I rely on data, voice of customer, and first principle thinking to create, deliver, and capture value.

**Background**

As Head of Ops and part of the Founding Team at [91springboard](https://www.91springboard.com), India’s largest coworking community, I built multiple departments adapting to our pace of growth going from serving 50 members in a basement to 20000 active members across 30 locations. I started my career in Software Development at [eBay](https://www.ebay.com) and built a foundation in Data Analytics & Management Consulting at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/). I studied Liberal Arts, General Management & Computer Science.

**Love to build**

Winning as a team makes me tick. This is also why [I love to play](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india) Ultimate Frisbee ([what?](https://wfdf.sport/disciplines/ultimate/)).

I'm always building, helping others build, and looking for folks who are deeply passionate about what they do - to work with and learn from them. [DM me](https://twitter.com/anilgeorge04) if you’re interested in creating value in any of these projects and organizations:
