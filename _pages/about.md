Hi! I'm Anil. With 10 years of experience in business & product operations, data analytics, program management, and consulting, I enjoy using data to create value for customers, capture value for the business, and build retention loops.

**Background**

I was Head of Ops and part of the Founding Team at [91springboard](https://www.91springboard.com), India’s largest coworking community. During the 6 years here, I worked across functions, adapted repeatedly, and built teams as we went from serving 50 members in a basement to 20000 active members across 30 locations.

I started my career in Software Development at [eBay](https://www.ebay.com) and built a foundation in Data Analytics & Management Consulting at [Mu Sigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/). I studied Liberal Arts, General Management & Computer Science from [Young India Fellowship](https://ashoka.edu.in/yif), [IIM Bangalore](https://www.iimb.ac.in/home) & [PSG College of Technology](https://www.psgtech.edu).

**Love to build**

Winning as a team makes me tick. This is also why I love to [play Ultimate Frisbee](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india).

I'm always building, helping others build, and looking for folks who are deeply passionate about what they do - to work with and learn from them. [DM me](https://twitter.com/anilgeorge04) if you’re interested in creating value in any of these projects and organizations:
