Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Anil, a Business Transformation Manager in the Strategy & Programs team at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com). 

I'm a software engineer turned management consultant with a post-graduate in Liberal Arts. I'm curious and seek to simplify things. In this process, I enjoy learning new perspectives, playing with data, pattern matching, and building solutions. Prior to Airbnb, I headed Operations at [91springboard](https://91springboard.com), a community-led coworking chain that we took from 0 to 1 to 10.

My friends and I started [STEP North East](https://stepnortheast.org), a non-profit to bridge education and opportunity gaps for inspiring girls in the North East of India through upskilling programs. Write to me if you'd like to teach or mentor or contribute in any way.

I play Ultimate Frisbee actively ([2023](https://indiaultimate.org/en_in/p/national-team-announcement-team-india-mixed-masters-for-aougc-2023), [2015](https://indiaultimate.org/2015-aouc-team-india)) and love to travel.
