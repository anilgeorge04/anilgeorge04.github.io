From tinkering around with a **game on Scratch** to building **image filters on C** to deploying a full-fledged **web application using Flask**, [this repository](https://github.com/anilgeorge04/cs50harvard) contains some of my projects submitted for CS50 - Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course taught by Professor David J. Malan.

I highly recommend [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) to anyone looking to build their Computer Science Fundamentals.

- Problem definition is detailed in [Problem Sets](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) section for each week
- The projects were built primarily using C and Python.

**Special Note to CS50 students**: Please follow the [Academic Honesty Guide](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/honesty/) from CS50. Go over what's reasonable and what's not within the policy before going into any folder and sub-folder in this repository. You'll thank yourself for it later.
