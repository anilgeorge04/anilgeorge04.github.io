From tinkering around with a **game on Scratch** to building **image filters on C** to deploying a full-fledged **web application using Flask**, [this repository](https://github.com/anilgeorge04/cs50harvard) contains some of my projects submitted for CS50 - Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course taught by Professor David J. Malan.

I highly recommend [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) to anyone looking to build their Computer Science Fundamentals.
