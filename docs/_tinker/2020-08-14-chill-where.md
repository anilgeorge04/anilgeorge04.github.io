## About
So you watch content on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney, Hotstar, YouTube and so on.

You come across a movie or TV show you want to watch. Do you then go into each platform one by one to check which one has it? Sounds tedious. Run the search from one place. Skip typing the URLs and search keyword again and again. Use [Chill Where](https://www.minimalcave.com/chillwhere) to find your favorite movies and TV shows faster.

## How to use?

- Search: Opens results in new tabs (enable pop-up for this site)
- CW Reset: Closes all tabs opened by Chill Where in one go

Looking to collaborate to remove dependency on multiple tabs and bringing within Chill Where soon.

**Pro-tip**: Sign into your subscribed platforms in advance to search seamlessly Ex: Netflix needs you to login to see search results.
